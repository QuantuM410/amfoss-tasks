Since Flutter installation required a couple of GBs of data I couldn't even try to attempt this task
I had connection problem with AMRITA CONNECT (some DNS problem) and had to visit ICTS 4 times and still didn't fix it. So I fixed it myself somehow
but it was already 10th DEC.
I still installed flutter and installed every other component required. Then I learnt a bit about spritecomponents and positionalcomponents and importing 
images. I wanted to complete it but the time didn't permit :(
