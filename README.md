## What I thought about the given tasks?
The tasks were very varied and distinct to each other. Each task demanded different kind of skill and had a different approach. The tasks helped me get an insight on different field of programming such as Web dev, Game dev etc. I personally found that the tasks were very perfect for someone like me to help me introduce to domains of coding and programming. I avoided reading documentations till now as they seemed overboarding but these tasks me go through documentations and ngl it felt like I was missing out on a whole lot of information. It also made me eager to do more projects and coding ASAP.
