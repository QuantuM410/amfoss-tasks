It was my second time creating a bot but first time a telegram bot so it 
was an overall new experience. It was my first time dealing with API keys and extracting data from websites
and it was a lot of fun till I reached the sending csv file part. I was able to create csv file but unable to 
send it ( I was using send_document(chat_id, document)) so I left it at that...
