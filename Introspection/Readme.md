# INTROSPECTION
### Why must we choose you?
I have been close to my computer since I was in grade 3 which naturally made me interested in coding and gaming. Just looking at a working code
which I wrote gives me satisfaction. I am always ready to learn and improve as I always like to be or seek to be as near as of a perfectionist I can
be. Saying that I know I might not know everything but I am eager and willing to do whatever I can in my power to know, learn, improve and prosper.
Of all things coding is the only thing I can kill my sleep for (apart from studying for Tests).
### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I want to be a part of as many projects I can be and contribute. I want to learn and explore a bit deeper into the different fields of programming
and choose one to dive deeper as I am not totally sure what to go for among all the varying options. I also want to maintain my GPA and if possible
achieve something.
## How would you contribute back to the club?
I will be happy to do what the club asks from me and will definitely achieve something which amfoss could be proud of. If I will be capable enough
in the future I would do my best to help the new members in the club
## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
It is one of the most organised ones I have been a part of. The clan system was new to me and pretty interesting. I would have loved a text channel where
each clan members could discuss and share their experiences. Also would have been good if there was a voice channel for every clan.
