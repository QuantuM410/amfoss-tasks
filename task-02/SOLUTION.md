## What I learnt and did throughout terminal hunt:
git clone to clone the repository

git log to check commit logs

git commit to commit the changes

ctrl + x to exit nano

git checkout asia to switch from main branch to asia branch

git merge asia to merge asia branch to the main branch

find . -name athens.txt to find the text file
